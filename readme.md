# rbjs

Augment JavaScript arrays with Ruby array methods, using Proxies.


## Installation

This package is not in `npmjs.org` yet, so for now it can be installed directly
from this repository.

```bash
$ npm install https://github.com/uncaughtxcptn/rbjs
```


## Usage

```js
import rbjs from 'rbjs';
```

In order to use Ruby array methods on JavaScript arrays, the array needs to be
proxied by passing it to the `rbjs` function.

```js
const array = rbjs([1, 2, 3]);
// `array` now contains all the implemented Ruby array methods

array.count(2); // => 1
```

### Using individual methods

The methods can also be used on their own, without importing the entire `rbjs`
library. This is done by importing the method definition directly.

```js
import count from 'rbjs/methods/count';

count([1, 2, 3], 2); // => 1
```

The caveat of using `rbjs` this way is that the array to operate on needs to be
passed as the first argument to the method being used.

### ES5 build

If you want to use the ES5 build of this library, they can be imported from the
`es5` subdirectory.

```js
const rbjs = require('rbjs/es5');
const count = require('rbjs/es5/methods/count');
```
